# svxlink_pirepeater8x
Updated configurations and support scripts for SVXLink to support the PI-REPEATER-8X from ICS

SVXLink was updated since the last commit to [OpenRepeater/svxlink-sample-configs](https://github.com/OpenRepeater/svxlink-sample-configs) in December of 2023, and the previous GPIO configuration was deprecated in favor of GPIOd. These configuration files are updated from svxlink-sample-configs to use GPIOd and for use at [The Northern Alberta Radio Club](https://tnarc.ca).
